# Xojo-iOSLibSpriteKit
An extension to iOSLib: iOSLibSpriteKit.  
This is a library for using SpriteKit on iOS with Xojo. iOSLibSpriteKit needs iOSLib to run but can be removed from source without breaking iOSLib (which is included here). Always tested on the current version of Xojo.

Please see the Wiki for documentation and examples.
