# Xojo-iOSLibSpriteKit
An extension to iOSLib: iOSLibSpriteKit.  
This is a library for using SpriteKit on iOS with Xojo. iOSLibSpriteKit needs iOSLib to run but can be removed from source without breaking iOSLib (which is included here). Always tested on the current version of Xojo.

By now, there's almost everything in except for SK3DNodes (don't make sense until there's a SceneKit too) and SKKeyFrameSequence (need to understand it first) and a handful of special constructors.  
The documentation is up to date and I will refine the demo views and add remarks for easier understanding.  
Not all of the classes are tested, and none of them to the full extent. There will surely be bugs and a lot of things that could be simplified. I will try to add and fix but depend on your help. 
Therefore please make use of the feedback features GitHub offers or simply send me a mail. And if you explore other features of SpriteKit not included in the demo views: I would love to add them!

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/UBogun/Xojo-iOSLibSpriteKit/wiki) for documentation and examples.
